# Password Generator
## Description
- This project focused on using JavaScript to provide a user with a password based off their preference of length, numbers, symbols, and lowercase and uppercase letters.
- I was able to practice using functions and if statements to create the passwords.

## Usage
- With this application, if I wanted a new password or someone else does, I can sue this to create a unique password that others may not have nor think of.
